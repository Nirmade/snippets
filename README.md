This is a collection of short scripts and programs.

They are described in more detail on [my website](http://www.woodruffw.us/snippets.html), and are **not** documented here.

Feel free to use them.

### Building

Most of these can be run directly via their interpreter.

For C/Java programs, run `make` in the program's directory.
